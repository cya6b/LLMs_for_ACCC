# Introduction
The framework is designed to enhance the compliance checking process in real-world engineering applications. By integrating a web-based system with 3D visualization, users can upload IFC models and interactively query building regulations through a large language model. The system leverages a domain-specific knowledge graph to identify non-compliant components and provides clear, traceable reports, all while highlighting problematic areas directly within the 3D model. This approach simplifies the workflow and significantly improves the efficiency of compliance checks, making it suitable for practical use in the AEC industry.
